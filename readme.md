This is my first real webpage project. The aim was to recreate the google homepage. 
it was actaually a lot more challenging than expected, but I learned a lot in 
the process. It is obviously not identical to google. but it's close!

Learned how to do basic content structure through HTML.
Learned basic design elements through CSS.
Learned how to use vsword for writting out my code.
Learned how to scour the web for vital website building information.
Learned how to use devtools on google and firefox to examine other code.
